This is a console-based Tic Tac Toe game developed using Python. The game features a 3×3 board where a human player (X) competes against a computer-controlled opponent (O). The computer makes its moves randomly from available positions.

The application handles turn-based gameplay, validates player inputs, updates the board after each move, and determines the game outcome by checking winning and tie conditions.
